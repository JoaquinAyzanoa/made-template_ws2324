# Correlation between air pollution and number of vehicles with combustion motors in Nordrhein-Westfalen.

This template project provides some structure for your open data project in the MADE module at FAU.
This repository contains (a) a data science project that is developed by the student over the course of the semester, and (b) the exercises that are submitted over the course of the semester.
Before you begin, make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Jayvee](https://github.com/jvalue/jayvee) installed. We will work with [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). The easiest way to do so is to set up [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Jupyter extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter).

## Main Question

1. Is the number of combustion motor vehicles the main factor in air pollution in Nordrhein-Westfalen?

## Description

This analysis helps to get a clear picture of how many cars pollute the air in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. This analysis also helps identify areas with a greater number of vehicles, which could potentially indicate a greater demand for services related to mechanical workshops and gasoline consumption. The resulting information may be relevant in a study that evaluates the number of vehicles a city can afford to have because high pollution can cause a high rate of respiratory diseases.
